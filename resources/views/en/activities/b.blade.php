                    <p>We will go South, along the Milodón River, this area is known as La Faja. After going through a burnt down forest, climbing 600 meters, we will have a breathtaking view on the glacier Milodón, framed by the impressive Cordón Huemul. The vegetation totally changes as the valley of the Condór begins. After a short rest, sheltered by the last trees to have lunch and in order for the horses to rest, we will keep on climbing. This area is inhabited by guanacos and condors that will surely be surprised by our presence. Arriving at the edge after the last efforts, we will stand in front of a breathtaking view, in the heart of the National Park, Los Glaciares. From the Mount Pintado to the Mount Fitz Roy, we stand in front of the ANDES.</p>
